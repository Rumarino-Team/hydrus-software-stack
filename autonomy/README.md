# Hydrus Autonomy System

The Hydrus Autonomy System is a comprehensive ROS-based underwater vehicle control and mission management framework. This README documents all available scripts, their purpose, and usage instructions.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The mission API is currently under development. Some features may not work as expected and are subject to change.


The autonomy system provides:
- **Mission Planning**: Hierarchical mission execution for competition tasks
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection using YOLO and color filtering
- **Motion Control**: Precise submarine navigation and thruster control
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring and visualization
- **Serial Communication**: Arduino integration for hardware control


// TODO: This module should have Sphinx or a Doxygen documentation.
