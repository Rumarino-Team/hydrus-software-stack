# Hydrus Software Stack - Philosophy & Contributions

Welcome to the Hydrus Software Stack! This document outlines our core philosophy, development principles, and contribution guidelines. **Every contributor must read and understand these principles before contributing to the project.**

## Our Vision

The Hydrus project aims to become **the definitive toolkit for underwater robotics and RobSub competitions** - a maintainable, production-ready system that dramatically reduces the friction for teams to build autonomous underwater vehicles.

### Core Goals

üéØ **Zero-Friction Usability**: Make it so easy to use that anyone can get started with minimal setup  
üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainable for Years**: Build software that remains stable and extensible over time  
üöÄ **Fast Development**: Move quickly while maintaining quality through good engineering practices  
üîß **Comprehensive Toolkit**: Provide solutions for the entire autonomy stack, not just pieces  
üìà **Scalable Architecture**: Design systems that grow with user needs and team sizes  

## Development Philosophy

### 1. Software Engineering Excellence in Robotics

Most amateur robotics projects suffer from poor software engineering practices. We reject this norm and embrace:

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing pipelines
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation on every change
- **Documentation-First**: Every feature, script, and package must be thoroughly documented
- **Refactoring Culture**: Constant improvement of code readability and structure
- **Logging & Visualization**: If you can't see it, you can't debug it efficiently

### 2. Python-First Development

**All scripts and primary functionality should be written in Python.**

**Why Python?**
- **Accessibility**: More developers can contribute and maintain the codebase
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Faster iteration and experimentation
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries for robotics, ML, and computer vision
- **Readability**: Self-documenting code that's easier to review and maintain

**Performance Rule**: Before implementing in another language, you must:
1. **Benchmark** the Python implementation
2. **Verify** it's not an architectural design problem
3. **Prove** the performance gain justifies the complexity cost

### 3. Minimal External Dependencies

**Especially avoid heavy dependence on ROS-specific libraries.**

**Principles**:
- Functionality should work outside the ROS ecosystem when possible
- Before adding a library, ask: "How hard would it be to implement the core functionality we need?"
- Prefer lightweight, focused solutions over heavyweight frameworks
- Make the system portable across different robotics platforms

### 4. Fast Development with Stability

**Current Phase**: Rapid growth and feature development
- Any contribution that adds value without breaking the system is welcome
- New ideas and experimentation are encouraged
- Move fast, but maintain quality through testing

**Future Goal**: Production-ready version with slower, more deliberate changes

### 5. Multi-Platform Integration Philosophy

**Why limit ourselves to one simulation environment?**

Support multiple platforms and tools:
- **Simulation**: Gazebo, Nvidia Omniverse, Unity, Godot, custom simulators
- **Hardware**: Various camera systems, IMUs, thrusters, controllers
- **Deployment**: Docker, bare metal, embedded systems, cloud

**Design Principle**: "It just works" regardless of the user's preferred environment

## Contribution Standards

### Documentation Requirements

Every contribution must include appropriate documentation:

#### üìÅ **Folders/Packages**
- Each folder must have a `README.md` explaining its purpose and contents
- Include usage examples and integration points

#### üöÄ **Scripts/Binaries**
- Clear docstrings explaining purpose, inputs, outputs
- Command-line help and usage examples
- Integration instructions with the broader system

#### üîß **Functions/Classes**
- Comprehensive docstrings with type hints
- Example usage in docstrings
- Clear parameter descriptions

### Code Quality Standards

#### ‚úÖ **Testing Requirements**
```python
# Every new feature requires:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks when relevant
```

#### üìù **Pull Request Standards**
- **Clear Description**: What does this PR do and why?
- **Testing Evidence**: Screenshots, test results, or demonstration videos
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly document any breaking changes
- **Documentation**: Include or update relevant documentation
- **Small & Focused**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix

#### üêõ **Issue Standards**
- **Clear Problem Statement**: What's broken or missing?
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to reproduce the issue
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: What should happen vs what happens
- **Environment Details**: OS, hardware, software versions
- **Proposed Solution**: Ideas for fixing (when applicable)

### Development Workflow

#### üèÉ **Fast Iteration Process**
1. **Prototype Quickly**: Get working version fast
2. **Add Tests**: Ensure it doesn't break
3. **Document**: Make it usable by others
4. **Refactor**: Improve code quality continuously
5. **Integrate**: Connect with existing systems

#### üîÑ **Continuous Improvement**
- **Refactoring Welcome**: Always improve readability and maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: After correctness and clarity
- **Architecture Evolution**: Big improvements through small, tested changes

## Technical Standards

### Logging Philosophy
```python
# Every component should provide rich logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log state changes, decisions, and errors
logger.info("Starting mission: %s", mission_name)
logger.debug("Processing waypoint: %s", waypoint)
logger.error("Failed to connect to hardware: %s", error)
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Graceful degradation and clear error messages
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error("Operation failed: %s", e)
    # Provide fallback or clear guidance
    return fallback_result()
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Use configuration files, not hardcoded values
config = load_config("mission_config.yaml")
threshold = config.get("detection_threshold", 0.5)
```

## Visualization & Debugging Tools

**Every major component should provide visualization capabilities:**

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboards for system state
- **Data Recording**: Capture data for offline analysis
- **Debug Interfaces**: Tools to inspect internal state
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing, resource usage, success rates

Example tools we encourage:
- Web-based status dashboards
- RViz visualizations for spatial data
- Command-line monitoring tools
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis

## Scaling Strategy

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Independent components with clear interfaces
- **Service-Oriented**: Use services/APIs instead of tight coupling
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled by config files
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new sensors, algorithms, missions

### Team Scaling
- **Clear Ownership**: Each module has maintainers
- **Onboarding Documentation**: New contributors can get started quickly
- **Review Process**: Code review ensures quality and knowledge sharing
- **Mentorship**: Experienced contributors help newcomers
