# Hydrus Software Stack

The Hydrus Software Stack is a comprehensive ROS-based toolkit for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and RobSub competitions. Built with maintainability, usability, and excellent software engineering practices at its core.

## 📖 Documentation

- **[Philosophy & Contributions](PHILOSOPHY.md)** - **Read this first!** Our development principles and contribution guidelines
- **[Autonomy System](autonomy/README.md)** - Complete guide to all autonomy scripts and components
- **[Docker Setup](docker/README.md)** - Detailed Docker configuration and deployment options

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites Check
Run our dependency doctor to check and install required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rumarino-Team/hydrus-software-stack.git
cd hydrus-software-stack

# Check and install dependencies (Docker, Python3, Git)
./doctor.sh
```

The doctor script will automatically detect your OS and offer to install missing dependencies. Required dependencies:
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container platform for isolated environments
- **Python3**: Required for Hocker and various scripts
- **Git**: Version control (usually pre-installed)

### Build and Run with Hocker
We use **Hocker** (Hydrus Docker), our intelligent deployment tool that automatically detects your platform and configures the optimal Docker environment.

```bash
# Make hocker executable
chmod +x docker/hydrus-docker/hocker

# Run with automatic platform detection
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker

# Test the installation
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --test

# Quick development mode
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --dev

# Force CPU-only mode
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --force-cpu
```

Hocker automatically detects your platform (CPU, NVIDIA GPU, WSL, or Jetson) and runs the appropriate Docker configuration with intelligent defaults. For detailed options and configurations, see the [Docker README](docker/README.md).

### Launch the Autonomy System
```bash
# Launch the complete autonomy stack
roslaunch autonomy simulation.launch

# Or launch individual components
roslaunch autonomy mission_planner.launch
roslaunch autonomy cv_publishers.launch
roslaunch autonomy controller.launch
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Intelligent Deployment**: Hocker automatically detects and configures your platform
- **Mission Planning**: Hierarchical mission execution for competition tasks (Gate, Slalom, Tagging)
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO-based object detection with configurable color filtering
- **Motion Control**: Precise 3-phase movement control (depth → rotation → linear)
- **Hardware Integration**: Arduino serial communication for thruster control
- **Simulation Ready**: Multi-platform simulation support with configuration groups
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring and visualization tools

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify your installation:

```bash
# Quick test with Hocker
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --test

# Manual testing
./run_tests.sh
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment Options

Hocker provides several configuration groups for different use cases:

```bash
# Development with live code editing
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --dev

# Testing and CI/CD
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --test

# Competition deployment
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --competition

# Simulation with rosbag playback
./docker/hydrus-docker/hocker --simulation
```
