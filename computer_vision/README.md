# Computer Vision  Package

## About

In this package, the Computer Vision Team is tasked with developing the Computer Vision Nodes for our autonomous submarine project.

## Preliminary Ideas

###  Key Algorithms

- **Color Filters**: 
  filters objects based on color. This should account for color tolerance and return number of objects filtered, bounding boxes, and confidence levels.

- **Image Matching**:
  A node dedicated to image matching or template matching. Given an input image (template), this node should locate the object within a larger image or frame. It should return a bounding box around the matched object and a confidence score.

- **Optical Flow**:
  This node will track the movement of specific points across frames in a video. The output should include the tracked pointâ€™s position in each frame.

- **Video Object Segmentation**:
  This node will predict and track the segmentation mask of an object across a video. Outputs include the segmentation mask, bounding box, object ID, and potential reidentification of the object as it moves through different frames.

- **Object Detection**:
  A node for detecting objects in real time, classifying them into predefined categories. This will likely integrate popular object detection models like YOLO or SSD.

- **Orientation of Objects**:
  This node will return the orientation or rotation of a detected object.

- **Plane Detection**:
  A node that identifies planes (e.g., walls or floors) in the image frames.
